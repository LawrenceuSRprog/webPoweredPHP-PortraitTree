# webPoweredPHP-PortraitTree
It displays a 1: N tree by populating a webpage. This design works downwards – so that every new level requires one or more new rows below the top of the picture. I am showing demos supporting the steps taken towards it.

The initial CONTENT files are called chap01_PortraitTree.PHP and chap01_PortraitTree.PDF since it shows the project as a single PHP file with documentation of what it does and what it is for.

The first "chapter" is only there to suggest the provisional idea and acts as proof of concept, using a single PHP file. Beyond this, the second chapter requires (at least):

    [as the root]: aaa_copyForChapter02_index
    [Work-Folder]: chap2_DWritesTable, C2_classFlowBrick, C2_classFindBrick and autoload
